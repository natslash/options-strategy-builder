## Process

1. Identify changed files via `git diff` or user request
2. Read [reference/code-review-checklist.md](reference/code-review-checklist.md) for review categories, severity levels, and output format
3. Review each file against the checklist
4. Report findings by severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low)

## Reference Files
